# PythonWebScraper

During my traineeship I made a webscraper for the wko website.
I was tasked with scraping data from newly founded companies.
Things scraped:
* Name of the company
* Short description of the kind of company they are (Sales, Marketing, etc)
* District in which they reside
* WKO link for more information

It is a bit over the top, since the script gives out the data in the shell before writing it in a csv file.
